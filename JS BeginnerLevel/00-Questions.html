        <h1>Beginner Level Questions</h1>
        <h3>Question #1</h3>
        <p>
            Take two numbers and find the minimum and maximum one. Display the result in a blue paragraph if min and max are different, otherwise display in green color. The results are centered in the page. No need to check if the user input is a number or not.
        </p>
        <h3>Question #2</h3>
        <p>
           Take three numbers, check if they are number or not. If all three input are numbers, then show their values and average in a paragraph. Otherwise, display an error message (At least one of your numbers is not correct) in red color. Paragraphs are centered. 
        </p>
        <h3>Question #3</h3>
        <p>
            Get two numbers (lower and upper limit) from the user. The numbers must be within 0 and 20 inclusive. Display numbers in an unordered list starting from lower limit to upper limit. Display the sum of all those numbers in a paragraph. If the first number (lower) is not lower than the second number (upper) or if the numbers are not within the limit [0,20], then show an error message.
        </p>
         <h3>Question #4</h3>
        <p>
            Generate 10 random numbers between 10 and 30 inclusive, [10,30]. Display each number in a paragraph whose font size is equal to that number.
        </p>
         <h3>Question #5</h3>
        <p>
            Generate 10 random numbers between 20 and 80 inclusive, [20,80]. First display their average in a bold text. Then, display each number in a separate paragraph. If the number is greater than average, display in blue color and bold way.
